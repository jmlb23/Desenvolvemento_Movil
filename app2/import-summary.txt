ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .idea/
* .idea/.name
* .idea/codeStyleSettings.xml
* .idea/compiler.xml
* .idea/copyright/
* .idea/copyright/profiles_settings.xml
* .idea/misc.xml
* .idea/modules.xml
* .idea/uiDesigner.xml
* .idea/vcs.xml
* .idea/workspace.xml
* AndroidManifest.xml
* ant.properties
* app2.eml
* app2.iml
* app2.userlibraries
* build.xml
* proguard-project.txt
* res/
* res/drawable-hdpi/
* res/drawable-hdpi/ic_launcher.png
* res/drawable-ldpi/
* res/drawable-ldpi/ic_launcher.png
* res/drawable-mdpi/
* res/drawable-mdpi/ic_launcher.png
* res/drawable-xhdpi/
* res/drawable-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png
* res/layout/
* res/layout/main.xml
* res/values/
* res/values/strings.xml

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
